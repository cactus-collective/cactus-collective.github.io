# Ideas Workshop: Promoting yourself through blog posts and talks

> * **Location**: Your computer, like everything right now
> * **When**: ~~Sunday March 28, 2021, 2PM to 4:30PM GMT~~ POSTPONED TBD
> * **Who**: All women and non-binary people who are in, or aspire to be in, the tech community ([UK residents and citizens](#why-only-uk-participants))

We encourage you to attend this **Ideas Workshop** if you are hesitant to write a blog post, do a demo at work, or present a talk at a meet-up or conference, or if you know you want to do these things, but don’t know what to write or talk about.

Why? We firmly believe that **sharing your work and ideas is good for your career**.

* Sharing your work makes sure you **get the credit**
* Sharing your work gets you **seen**
* Visibility leads to having **influence**; you are **consulted** for more decisions
* Contributing to more decisions give you **experience** and more visibility
* Being experienced makes you **valuable** and gives you **choices**

We hope you each leave this workshop with at least one idea you can expand into a blog post, demo at work, or talk, and meet some new like-minded people along the way.

See you there?

Attendees will receive a **free care package**. Your care package from [The Second Shelf](https://www.thesecondshelf.com/), London’s lovely intersectional feminist bookshop.

Note: This session will not be recorded. If the day and time rolls around, and you aren’t feeling into it, **do still consider attending for the social aspect**. Our hope is that you leave feeling more energised than when you arrived, but if at any time, you want to just watch and listen, or drop out entirely, you can.

## HOW TO PREPARE

* You will take most of your notes privately. Come ready with your preferred note paper, text editor, a Google Doc, etc.
* For the ice breaker: think of one TV show, film, or book that you loved as a child that you are comfortable sharing with the group.
* Bring a cup of tea, biscuit, blanket etc, that makes you feel comfortable.
* Consider going for a walk or play some music ahead of time to feel refreshed.
* Brace yourself for a bit of awkwardness as we all arrive. It’s weird in person or online, but we’ll get through it!

## WHO IS CACTUS COLLECTIVE?

We are intersectional feminists working to build a network of people who are interested in radical change in the tech industry, and connecting with people who would benefit from such change. This workshop is just one little piece of that effort.

## WHY ONLY UK PARTICIPANTS?

This event is funded by [The National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/) with the requirement to support the UK intersectional feminist tech community. We will run this workshop again for a broader community if this event is successful and we see there is interest.
